# BCF2 Group 2 - Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction
Repository for SC1015 Intro to DSAI AY21/22 Sem 2 project

Application of the Machine Learning Pipeline in the order of
  1) Data Extraction & Preparation
  2) Exploratory Data Analysis
  3) Classification
  4) Linear Regression

Team Members:
  1) Chia Lu Ting (EDA)
  2) Lai Shi Hong (Classification)
  3) Daniel Li Runze (Linear Regression)

Problem Statement:
How different variables affect the receptiveness of cross-selling of insurance among existing policyholders?
What is the pricing strategy of the insurance company?

Models Used:

	Classification:
		1) Decision Tree
		2) Random Forest
		3) MLP
		4) XGBoost
	
	Linear Regression:
		1) Least Square
		2) Gradient Descent
		3) Adams Method
		4) Singular Value Decomposition

Conclusion:

	1) 13-18% of people are interested in the cross-sell
	2) Company should target people who faced vehicle damage, have older vehicles, or are in the older age groups.
	3) Insufficient data on customer background to conclusively come up with their pricing mechanism.
